# CCLI - Chrome Command Line Interface

## Description
[skip this boring stuff](https://github.com/poistooshort/ccli?tab=readme-ov-file#table-of-contents)  
CCLI is a chrome extension that brings command line style tools to the user at the press of a shortcut key / shortcut key combination.

Mainly, this project is to get myself coding in a public space. Secondly, it allows me to consolidate a bunch of random tools I have hacked together for personal use since I've started coding, into one project.

UPDATE: I am currently mainly focused on learning about Cybersecurity and trying to get my certifications for that but will begin trying to set aside a little bit of time each day to progress with this.
